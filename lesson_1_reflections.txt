How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Showed the differences in the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can save versions when significant changes are made.  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because multiple files can be affected by a change, even if the change is made to only one file. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log retrieves a chronological list of commits w/ accompanying description; git diff compares two separate commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	If you break something, you can revert to a previous version of code and proceed.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	to create and experiment
